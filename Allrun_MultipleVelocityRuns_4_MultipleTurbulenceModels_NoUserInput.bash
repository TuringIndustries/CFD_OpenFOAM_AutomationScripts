#------------ This script is intented for sequential runs of k_epsilon and kOmegaSSt (or any turbulence models) runs ----------

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  First, kEpsilon runs; low resolution mesh case is solved using potentialFoam + solver -----------
#  Then the first case solution is mapped to the any finer resolution mesh of the same turbulence model--
#  Then, the high resolution latest turbulence model case is mapped to the low resolution kOmega solution----------

#---------------------------And the process repeated...---------------------------------------------

#  Aiming to obtain a high resolution kEpsilon, and kOmegaSST (or any turbulence model) solution for the same domain parameters
#-------------------(e.g for a particular flow speed for the same domain)--------------------------
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#-------------------This script assumes that the case setup is as follows:--------------------------

# The case has a parent folder containing three folders; 0_orig_ALL, Original_Setup_ALL, and System_changes_All


#  ----------------------- For Original_Setup_ALL -----------------------------------------------
# Cases for each turbulence model should be stored in the Original_Setup_ALL folder in seperate folders for each Turbmodel
# Each case run folder should contain only the constant and system folders, and the 0 folder will be copied from 0_orig_ALL for each case.

# Names for each turbulence model folder Original_Setup_ALL should begin with "1_kEpsilon_", "2_kOmega_", "3_*" etc, to define the order of simulation
# Internal cases should be ordered so the low resolution mesh begins with "1_*", and the higher mesh's to be tested are "2_ExampleCase", "3_ExampleCase" etc, again to define the order


#  ------------------------ For 0_orig_ALL ---------------------------------------------------
# The runs are determined by the number of 0.orig folders in the 0_orig_ALL case folder, which should be labelled "0.1Run1_example", "0.Velocity_3_05_m_s" etc.:
## The 0.orig file extension is used as the basename:
# - e.g. if each file is 0.Run1_Velcocity_3_05_m_s will give a run name of Run1_Velcocity_3_05_m_s

# For each 0.orig folder a new case folder will be created, and the runs for each turbulence model (in this case k-Epsilon and k_OmegaSST) will be completed 
# based on the number of folders in Original_Setup_ALL, with each folder corrsponding to a particular mesh or similar parameter case to be run'


#  ------------------------ For System_changes_ALL ---------------------------------------------------

#--The forces, and forceCoeffs function objects need to be modified for certain changes (flow velocity, density, geometry)
#--Include these entires for each velocity run in a folder called the same name as the 0.orig folder for each run, to be copied into the system folder of each case using the -force option


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#--Apart from that the script should (hopefully) then run for different case setups -----------------
#--Need to be careful if the process fails at certain points, then the solution won't run for the subsequent cases until it reaches a new velocity run...
# Can be modified to alter anything in the 0 folder, system folder, (and easily constant folder for each case). 

# Can be called by a parent script to first run meshing for all of the specified runs, before copying them to the correct folders, but may be better to run seperately

# The names of the setup folders can be set to a user input variable if required by setting Original_Setup_ALL="Location/Name of base case..." etc

# For each 0-folder relating to a new velocity run â€“ stored somewhere in the case folder
